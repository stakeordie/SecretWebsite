## Secret Network Committees

</template>

<slim-column>

Secret Network is community-governed, both on-chain and off-chain. Our mission is to scale the global adoption of open-source, privacy-centric technologies that help support human empowerment and freedom.

There is no more consequential way to get involved with Secret Network than to [become a Secret Agent](https://airtable.com/shr6FPA7SW6p2gDTY) and join a Secret Committee. Committees are made up of experts and enthusiasts working together to build our network and ecosystem. Members often also run validators, build apps, do research, create educational content, organize communities and events, and much more!

If you'd like to contribute to any of the below committees - or start your own - [join the official Secret Chat](https://chat.scrt.network) and [get in touch with us](https://airtable.com/shr6FPA7SW6p2gDTY) to become a Secret Agent!
