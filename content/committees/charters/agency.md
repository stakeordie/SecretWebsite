# Secret Agency Committee Charters

This document will be our starting point for collaborating on a multi-purpose charter that unifies all the committees of Secret Network.

We can develop examples of these for each and every committee, while thinking about how to frame a kind of "meta-governance committee" for the overall shared purpose of Secret network.

That would provide common sources of truth in contextualized project groups working together, according to particular missions:

## WIP Charters

### [Development Committee](https://github.com/SecretFoundation/SecretWebsite/blob/master/content/committees/charters/dev-charter.md)

### [Education Committee]()

### [Awareness Committee]()

### [Infrastructure Committee]()

### [Governance Committee]()
